          <p>
            Final-year Marketing Technology student with experience in brand storytelling and cross-functional communication
            through academic and club projects. My work spans sustainability-focused research, digital marketing materials,
            and stakeholder engagement across multiple platforms. With strong analytical skills in content strategy and
            performance measurement, I combine creative and data-driven approaches to marketing initiatives. Passionate about
            e-commerce and digital innovation, I am eager to contribute to content creation, video production, and event
            support in collaborative environments.
